## Server Code : Kotlin
Server socket <br>
Swing GUI to show sesnor Data


## Client : Android App
Jetpack compose <br>

### Note the server code isn't perfect it's just for testing

The app code could use some refactor in the models.
feel free to do it yourself because i'm probably not coming back to this weekend project ;)
