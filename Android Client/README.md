## Client : Android App
Jetpack compose <br>
Sensors <br>
View model

The app code could use some refactor in the models.
feel free to do it yourself because i'm probably not coming back to this weekend project ;)

This is the Android app Branch. 
The server has its own Branch.

This is to make cloning the project easier
